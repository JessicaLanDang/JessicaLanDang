# Welcome to Jessica's Personal Hideout! ðŸŒŸ

## Who am I?

Hey there! I'm Jessica (also known as Lan Dang, but Jessica is my preferred name). Nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹

## What am I up to?

I'm currently in my 4th year, rocking a double major in Neuroscience and 'Biochemistry and Molecular Biology'(sounds boring right, I know and I feel it too).

## My academic journey

I started out as a Biochemistry student, but fate had other plans. In my third year, I came across a Neuroscience course and it was love at first sight! ðŸ’˜ I initially took it as minor, but the more I learned, the more I fell in love with it.

Fast forward to now, I have taken a double major of Biochemistry and Neuroscience, and Neuroscience has become my primary major. I'm even working as a lab technician, diving deep into the world of data analysis. It's been quite a journey to me!

## Why am I taking this course?

As I mentioned, I'm working in the Crowder lab as a tech (we have some cool stuffs and I'd be happy to talk about my research project if that piqued your interest ðŸ˜‰). Here's the thing: I didn't have any prior coding experience or knowledge. Everything I've learned about Matlab and coding has been self-taught, with a little guidance from Dr. Crowder himself. 

I'm here because: 
1. I believe this course will be incredibly beneficial for my career.
2. After discovering my love for data analysis with Matlab, I want to foster this new interest and skill set.

## What sparked my interest in Neuroscience?

It all started in my first term of my third year when I took the course Perceptual Processes (NESC 2150). That's when it hit me - I wasn't just interested in the molecular aspects typical of hard sciences, nor was I solely drawn to the environmental and behavioural aspects of Psychology. What really captivated me was the connection between these two worlds. I fell in love with how the brain, nervous system, and body shaped our perception of the world, our emotions, learning processes, and decision-making - both consciously and unconsciously. It's absolutely thrilling to explore the underlying mechanisms that drive our behaviour. 

In essence, I'm fascinated by how "the brain makes us behave as we do." ðŸ§ âœ¨

## What's next for me?

My ultimate goal right now is to get into medical school. However, as an international student, there are some hurdles to overcome:
1. I'm not currently eligible to apply to most medical school in Canada (as of my international status).
2. Even if I were, the tuition fees are astronomical! ðŸ’¸

So here's my game plan:
1. Graduate with my double major.
2. Take a gap year or two to work and gain experience.
3. Apply for permanent residency.
4. Get back on track to pursue my dream of medical school!

It's a long road ahead, but I'm excited for the journey and all the neuroscience adventures along the way! Who knows if some day I'll change my mind and do something else? ðŸš€
